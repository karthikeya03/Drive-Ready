	SESSION 6 : CLOUD STORAGE 

•	What is Cloud Storage?
- In Cloud Computing, Cloud storage is a virtual locker where we can remotely stash any data.
-  When we upload a file to a cloud-based server like Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud that file gets copied over the Internet into a data server that is cloud-based actual physical space where companies store files on multiple hard drives. 
- Most companies have hundreds of the ESE servers known as ‘server farms’ spanning across multiple locations. 
- So, if our data gets somehow lost, we will not lose our data because it will be backed up by another location. This is known as redundancy which keeps our data safe from being lost.

•	Features of Cloud Storage System:
The key features of cloud computing are as follows.
- It has a greater availability of resources.
- Easy maintenance is one of the key benefits of using Cloud computing.
- Cloud computing has a Large Network Access.
- It has an automatic system.
- Security is one of the major components and using cloud computing you can secure all over the networks.

•	Storage Systems in the Cloud
       There are 3 types of storage systems in the Cloud as follows.
    1. Block-Based Storage System
    2. File-Based Storage System
    3. Object-Based Storage System
1. Block-Based Storage System
•	What it is: Think of it like a traditional hard drive in your computer.
•	How it works: You get a big storage space (like 1000 GB), and you can split it into smaller parts (like 800 GB for one use and 200 GB for another).
•	Example: Your computer's C: and D: drives.
2. File-Based Storage System
•	What it is: Imagine a shared folder on a network that you can access from different computers.
•	How it works: You connect to this storage over a network. It’s like accessing a folder that’s on another computer. This folder is already set up and ready to use.
•	Example: Network-attached storage (NAS) devices. You map this storage to a drive letter on your computer.
•	In this, you are actually connecting through a Network Interface Card (NIC). You are going over a network, and then you can access the network-attached storage server (NAS). NAS devices are file-based storage systems.
3. Object-Based Storage System
•	What it is: Picture a big online storage bin where you put files (called objects).
•	How it works: You upload and manage files using web browsers and HTTP protocols. Each file is equal in this storage, with no folders or hierarchy.
•	Example: When you upload photos to a website or store files in services like Amazon S3.
•	In this, a user uploads objects using a web browser and uploads an object to a container i.e., Object Storage Container. This uses the HTTP Protocols with the rest of the APIs (for example: GET, PUT, POST, SELECT, DELETE).
•	There is no hierarchy of objects in the container. Every file is on the same level in an Object-Based storage system.
       Visual Analogy
1.	Block Storage: Like a bookshelf where you can decide how to organize books into different shelves.
2.	File Storage: Like a shared drive at work where everyone can access and use pre-organized folders and files.
3.	Object Storage: Like a giant bin where you can throw in files without worrying about organizing them into folders. You just use tags or unique IDs to find them later.
