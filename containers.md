# SESSION 10 : Evolution from On-Premise Servers to Microservices :

## 1. On-Premise Servers

- **Description**: Traditional model where servers and infrastructure are managed in-house.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Hardware**: Physical servers located on-premises.
  - **Maintenance**: Managed by internal IT teams.
  - **Scalability**: Limited by physical capacity; requires hardware upgrades for scaling.
  - **Cost**: High initial investment in hardware and infrastructure.

## 2. Virtualization

- **Description**: Introduction of virtual machines to optimize hardware utilization.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Hardware**: Virtual servers on top of physical hardware.
  - **Maintenance**: Still managed internally but with improved resource allocation.
  - **Scalability**: Easier to scale compared to physical servers.
  - **Cost**: Reduced hardware costs due to better resource utilization.

## 3. Cloud Computing

- **Description**: Utilizes cloud providers to deliver computing resources over the internet.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Hardware**: Managed by cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure).
  - **Maintenance**: Minimal internal management; cloud provider handles infrastructure.
  - **Scalability**: On-demand scaling; pay-as-you-go model.
  - **Cost**: Variable cost based on usage; no upfront hardware investment.

## 4. Containers

- **Description**: Lightweight, portable units that package applications and dependencies.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Hardware**: Runs on shared operating systems.
  - **Maintenance**: Easier deployment and management compared to VMs.
  - **Scalability**: Fast scaling and deployment of applications.
  - **Cost**: Efficient use of resources; reduced overhead compared to VMs.

## 5. Microservices

- **Description**: Architectural style where applications are composed of small, independent services.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Hardware**: Typically deployed in cloud or containerized environments.
  - **Maintenance**: Decentralized; each service is managed independently.
  - **Scalability**: Fine-grained scaling of individual services.
  - **Cost**: Efficient use of resources; potentially lower costs with improved performance and scalability.
