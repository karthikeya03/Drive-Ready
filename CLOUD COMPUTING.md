# SESSION 7: CLOUD COMPUTING

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing refers to the practice of using remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than relying on a local server or a personal computer. It’s a way to access computing resources and services over the internet, making it possible to use applications, store files, and perform various computing tasks without needing physical hardware on your premises.

## Key Points:
- **Internet-Based Computing:** Cloud computing delivers services and resources over the internet.
- **Remote Servers:** Data and applications are stored in data centers managed by cloud providers.
- **Storable Documents:** Includes files, images, documents, and other data types.

## Operations in Cloud Computing:
Here are some common operations that can be performed using cloud computing:

1. **Storage, Backup, and Recovery of Data:**
   - Store files and data securely.
   - Backup important information to prevent data loss.
   - Recover data easily in case of accidental deletion or system failure.

2. **Delivery of Software on Demand:**
   - Access and use software applications without needing to install them on local devices.
   - Examples include SaaS (Software as a Service) applications like Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace.

3. **Development of New Applications and Services:**
   - Create and deploy new applications without needing physical hardware.
   - Use development platforms provided by cloud services, like PaaS (Platform as a Service).

4. **Streaming Videos and Audio:**
   - Stream multimedia content such as movies, music, and podcasts.
   - Services like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube rely on cloud computing for content delivery.

## Architecture of Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing architecture comprises several key components:

1. **Front End:**
   - **Fat Client:** A powerful client device (like a desktop or laptop) with substantial processing power.
   - **Thin Client:** A lightweight client device (like a web browser or terminal) that relies heavily on server-side processing.

2. **Back-End Platforms:**
   - **Servers:** Powerful machines that host cloud services and applications.
   - **Storage:** Systems that store data, ensuring reliability and redundancy.

3. **Cloud-Based Delivery and Network:**
   - **Internet:** Global network connecting clients and servers, enabling access to cloud services.
   - **Intranet:** Private network using internet technologies restricted to an organization.
   - **Intercloud:** Connected global network of clouds, enabling interoperability between different cloud systems.

## Cloud Computing Services:
The following are types of cloud computing services:

- **Onsite**
- **IAAS → Infrastructure as a service**
- **PAAS → Platform as a serice**
- **SAAS → Software as a Service**
- **FAAS → Functional as a service**
- **CAAS → Containers as a servive**

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
   - **Flexibility and Control:** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including VMs, storage, and networks.
   - **Reducing Hardware Expenses:** Avoids high costs of physical hardware by paying for what is used.
   - **Scalability of Resources:** Allows scaling of hardware resources based on demand for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

   Example: AWS, GCE, AZURE VMs, Google Cloud

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
   - **Simplifying Development:** Offers a platform for application development without managing underlying infrastructure.
   - **Enhancing Efficiency and Productivity:** Reduces complexity, speeds up development, and automates scaling of resources.
   
   Example: Google App Engine, Azure App Engine

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
   - **Collaboration and Accessibility:** Access software applications over the internet without local installation.
   - **Automation of Updates:** Providers handle software maintenance, ensuring access to latest features and security enhancements.
   - **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces IT costs by eliminating software licenses and minimizing IT support needs.
   
   Example: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365

4. **Function as a Service (FaaS)**
   - **Event-Driven Execution:** Executes code in response to specific events without managing servers.
   - **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for compute resources used, promoting cost-effective scalability and agility.
   
   Example: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions
