# Scenario 1 : 


# Scenario 2 : 
>You started your shift. There is an unusually high volume of customer contacts. You take your first case: a customer opened a critical priority case reporting a slow server where overall service performance is heavily degraded. Specifically, it has gone from full to half speed. You learn that due to their severely degraded service, their customers are having difficulty accessing their online services. You are currently in a chat session with the customer. Please note that at Amazon, servers are referred to as instances.
