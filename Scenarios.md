# Scenario 1 : 


## Scenario 2:

You started your shift. There is an unusually high volume of customer contacts. You take your first case: a customer opened a critical priority case reporting a slow server where overall service performance is heavily degraded. Specifically, it has gone from full to half speed. You learn that due to their severely degraded service, their customers are having difficulty accessing their online services. You are currently in a chat session with the customer. Please note that at Amazon, servers are referred to as instances.

### Task 1:

The customer later provided the names of the other servers that were experiencing similar issues. Upon reviewing the data, you were able to determine that this is a storage performance issue. What step would you take now?

1. Respond to the customer saying there is a storage issue and that you are escalating the issue to the internal team.

   | Highly Ineffective  | Ineffective | Slightly Ineffective | Neutral | Slightly Effective | Effective | Highly Effective |
   | ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- |
   | ███████████████████ |             |                      |         |                    |           |                  |

   - This is highly ineffective. While you are acknowledging the issue, immediately escalating without further investigation or providing a potential solution can cause unnecessary delays and frustration for the customer.

2. Check the internal service health dashboard to see if there are any widespread issues for that particular service.

   | Highly Ineffective | Ineffective | Slightly Ineffective | Neutral | Slightly Effective | Effective | Highly Effective    |
   | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------------- |
   |                    |             |                      |         |                    |           | ███████████████████ |

   - This is highly effective. Identifying whether there are known issues with the service helps determine if the problem is isolated or widespread. This is a crucial first step in troubleshooting and can help you provide accurate information to the customer.

3. Respond to the customer by saying the metrics indicate a storage issue and they should look at increasing storage performance.

   | Highly Ineffective | Ineffective | Slightly Ineffective | Neutral | Slightly Effective | Effective | Highly Effective    |
   | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------------- |
   |                    |             |                      |         |                    |           | ███████████████████ |

   - This is highly effective. Transparency with the customer about the nature of the issue is important. Additionally, suggesting ways to increase storage performance, such as increasing IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), can help address the problem quickly and efficiently.

4. Escalate the case and wait for a response from the internal team before responding to the customer.

   | Highly Ineffective  | Ineffective | Slightly Ineffective | Neutral | Slightly Effective | Effective | Highly Effective |
   | ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- |
   | ███████████████████ |             |                      |         |                    |           |                  |

   - This is highly ineffective. Escalating the case without further investigation or communication with the customer can lead to delays and dissatisfaction. It's important to gather as much information as possible and provide immediate steps or updates.

5. Send a group message to your team to see if they are seeing similar issues.

   | Highly Ineffective | Ineffective | Slightly Ineffective | Neutral | Slightly Effective | Effective | Highly Effective    |
   | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------------- |
   |                    |             |                      |         |                    |           | ███████████████████ |

   - This is highly effective. Collaborating with your team to identify if others are experiencing similar issues can provide additional insights and solutions. It also ensures that you are not working in isolation and can leverage the collective knowledge of the team.
