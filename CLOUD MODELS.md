# SESSION 8: Cloud Deployment Models

## Public Cloud
A **Public Cloud** is a cloud computing model in which the infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a third-party provider and made available to the public over the internet. The public can access and use shared resources, such as servers, storage, and applications, and the main advantage is that you pay for what you use.

**Examples of public cloud providers:**
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Private Cloud
A **Private Cloud** is a cloud computing environment where the infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a single organization, such as a company or government, and accessed only by authorized users within that organization. Private clouds often have their own data centers and provide a higher level of security.

**Examples of private cloud providers:**
- HPE
- Dell
- VMware

## Hybrid Cloud
A **Hybrid Cloud** is a combination of both public and private cloud environments that allows organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both types of clouds. This model manages traffic levels during peak usage periods and provides greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness than using a single cloud environment.

**Examples of hybrid cloud providers:**
- IBM
- DataCore Software
- Rackspace
- Threat Stack
- Infinidat
